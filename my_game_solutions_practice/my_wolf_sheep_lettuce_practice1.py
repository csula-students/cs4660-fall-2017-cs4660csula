My solution to the game is as follows

######################################

We have three variables in the form of 


String wolf, goat, lettuce;


array[] boatArray = []; 


piece_of_land_A = A


piece_of_land_B = B


We need to move all three Strings from A to B.
However, we can't lost any elements in the process.
